# backend-microservices-bundle
One project to combine the microservice APIs required to finish FCC's backend course


## Timestamp Microservice ##
This one taught me that dates (and timezones in particular) are a right royal PITA to work with.


## Request Header Parser ##
Compared to working with dates, this task was super easy, barely an inconvenience.
